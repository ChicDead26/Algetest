This was a project i submitted as part of a job application back in 2021. I had to follow the instructions and develop a program in Unity where the user could simulate the heating and cooling of an object.

In this test, however, i couldn't properly recreate the cooling as described in the document. That document is included here, but it's entirely in brazilian portuguese, alongside some of my notes.

I believe the expected test to be wrong, as i don't belive i made any mistake with my formulas. If that happens to not be the case, please let me know!
