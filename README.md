This was a project i submitted as part of a job application back in 2021. I had to follow the instructions and develop a program in Unity where the user could simulate the heating and cooling of an object.

In this test, however, i couldn't properly recreate the cooling as described in the document. That document is included here, but it's entirely in brazilian portuguese, alongside some of my notes.

I believe the expected test to be wrong, as i don't belive i made any mistake with my formulas. If that happens to not be the case, please let me know!

Also do let me know if i accidentally included my own sensitive information here.

WASD to move, E to unlock/lock the mouse, M1 to pick up the cubes, use the thermometer and to spin the busen burner (the cilindrical part near the bottom). Place the cube on top of the burner!
